	<h2>Hilary Mason</h2> 
	<p>Hilary Mason is the General Manager for Machine Learning at Cloudera. Previously, she founded Fast Forward Labs, an applied machine learning research and advisory company, which was acquired by Cloudera in 2017. Hilary is the Data Scientist in Residence at Accel Partners, and is on the board of the Anita Borg Institute. Formerly, she co-founded HackNY.org, a non-profit that helps engineering students find opportunities in New York's creative technical economy, served on Mayor Bloomberg's Technology Advisory Council, and was the Chief Scientist at Bitly.

	<h2>Thea Arrestad</h2> 
	
	<p> When attempting to apply machine learning to particle physics problems, there are a few things that require special care: Firstly, you want the output to have a physical meaning. There is for instance no such thing as particles with a negative mass. Secondly, you want to be able to learn something from the algorithm itself that you perhaps didn’t know before hand. Are there any correlations present that you haven’t thought of? How can you give your weights a physical meaning that can be interpreted by a human? Thirdly, you need to make sure you are training an unbiased algorithm. If it is not, you can not trust its output when applied to real data with an unknown truth distribution. 	</p>

	<p>I am currently working with a deep neural network architecture designed to tackle the issues above. With a training input consisting of particles motion in space and time only, their “four-vectors”, we equip the neural network architecture with the tools it needs to do calculations in spacetime (so-called Minkowski space).
The network is given low-level quantities only, with the hope that it will reconstruct high-level features on its own. And, additionally, that we can learn which features the network chooses to design. 	</p>
	<p>The weights correspond to physical quantities reconstructed by the algorithm; distance between particles, masses and energies, linear combinations of particle four-vectors etc. The end goal is to discriminate between particles originating from different processes and, on the way, to hopefully learn something about new unknown discriminating features. 	</p>

	<p>For us, the question “What can we teach the machine?” is getting less interesting than the question “What can we learn from the machine?” and, by probing the neural network output, we hope to learn something new about physical processes. 	</p>

	<h2>Kathleen Siminyu</h2>
	<p>Kathleen is a data scientist and machine learning engineer who attributes her achievements to a commitment to continual self-learning and improvement. She is Head of Data Science at 
	  <a href = "https://africastalking.com/">Africa’s Talking </a>, Co-Founder and Co-Organiser of the 
	  <a href = "https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Nairobi-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science/"> Nairobi Women in Machine Learning and Data Science </a> community as well as part of the 
	  <a href = "http://www.deeplearningindaba.com/">Deep Learning Indaba </a> Steering Committee. </p>

	<p>With a background in Mathematics and Computer Science and having set up the data department at a startup, she has hands on experience with a wide range of data-related tasks including data scraping, munging, cleaning, analytics and visualization, using Sata Science to uncover insights, deploying ML models as well as building a distributed data infrastructure using Scala, Kafka, Spark, HDFS and HBase.</p>

	<p>She is currently a Masters student at the Georgia Institute of Technology undertaking the Online Masters in Computer Science with a specialization in Computational Perception and Robotics. Kathleen is keen on investing time and effort in ventures that involve natural language processing for African languages as well as low-cost hardware robotics.</p>

	<h2> Monique Morrow</h2> 
	<p>Monique Morrow is President and Co-Founder of the Humanized Internet, a non-profit organization focused on providing digital identity for those individuals most underserved, and most importantly the need to control our identities. 	
	  <a href = "https: www.thehumanizedinternet.org"> The Humanized Internet</a> </p> 
	  
	<p> Monique believes in the social good for technology with embedded ethics where one can respond to cognitive bias. Monique’s focus in blockchain has been specific to education and credentialing, in addition to blockchain’s applicability in other industries for example, healthcare Internet of Things and insurance. She has been active in the Bitcoin- Blockchain and Ethereum [Smart contracting] architectural discussions including the application of security-privacy. i.e. SHA-256 vs SHA-3 mechanisms and the use of secure multi-party computation [sMPC]. It is this intersectionality between blockchain technology, security-privacy, legal jurisdiction and portfolio development that has been Monique’s blockchain focus. She holds several industry advisory positions and most recently Venture Partner Sparklabs Accelerator for Cybersecurity and Blockchain, Wash D.C.      	</p> 

	<p> Recognized as one of the most influential technology leaders worldwide, Monique has earned honors that include Top 100 CIOs for 2016 (CIO.com), Top Women in Cloud Innovations Award 2016 (CloudNow), Social Media Presence of the Year 2016 (AI Magazine), 10 Women in Networking/Communications You Should Know, Top 10 Influential IT Women in Europe (Think Progress), 2015 Women of M2M/IoT (Connected World Magazine), and 2014 GEM-TECH Award (ITU and UN). She is a tireless advocate for women in technology and engineering, serving on multiple non-profit boards, publishing Internet of Women, Accelerating Culture Change in 2016 and facilitating the launch of the Women in Standardization Expert Group for ITU.

        <h2> Nell Watson</h2>
        <p>Nell Watson is an engineer, educator, and tech philosopher who grew up in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p>Nell founded Poikos (now QuantaCorp). This original, patented technology enables fast and simple 3D body measurement from only two planes (front and side), using a simple cellphone camera, by applying sophisticated deep learning technologies.This service enables fast and accurate personalization services in telemedicine, mass customization, and retail.</p>
	
	<p>Today, Nell educates others in how to implement such technologies, for example, by creating video coursebooks for O’Reilly.</p>

	<p>She is also Co-Founder of EthicsNet, a non-profit, building a movement of people who are committed to help machines understand humans better. This community acts as role models and guardians to raise kind AI, by providing virtual experiences, and collecting examples of pro-social practices.</p>

	<p>In her spare time, Nell enjoys coding games, such as her startup life simulator, Founder Life. Founder Life attempts to teach the mindfulness and psychological habits necessary for entrepreneurs to consistently execute under pressure.</p>

	<p>Nell lectures globally on Machine Intelligence, AI philosophy, Human-Machine relations, and the Future of Human Society, serving on the Faculty of AI & Robotics at Singularity University.</p>
